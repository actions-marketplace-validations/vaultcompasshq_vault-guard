// Runs action.yml's own install and run steps against REAL npm, with a checkout

//   node bench/action-install.cjs --compare
//   node bench/action-install.cjs --write-baseline
//   node bench/action-install.cjs --action-file /path/to/some/action.yml
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. packages/cli/src/__tests__/action/action-run-script.test.ts
// executes the same step scripts under the same shell flags, and it STUBS npm.
// That proves the action no longer asks npm to run from inside the checkout. It
// cannot prove what real npm does when it is asked to, because a stub does
// whatever the stub says. Both attack routes are decisions the real client
// makes:
//
//   1. A committed `.npmrc` repoints the registry npm fetches from. npx in
//      non-global mode reads project configuration from its cwd, so a pull
//      request adding one root file chooses where the scanner comes from.
//   2. A copy already in the checkout's node_modules wins outright.
//      `npx pkg@version` in a tree that already satisfies that spec runs the
//      local copy and never contacts a registry, so the version pin degrades
//      from a choice of program into a satisfaction check on a package the head
//      wrote.
//
// NO NETWORK. Two registries run on 127.0.0.1 on ephemeral ports for the life of
// the run. The legitimate one serves this worktree's own packages, packed the
// way a publish packs them, plus their dependency closure. The hostile one
// serves a stand-in at the same name and the same exact version whose bin writes
// a marker and exits 0 with an empty SARIF log. Pointing a proven attack at a
// public registry is not a thing to do on purpose, and a harness that needs the
// internet is a harness that stops being run.
//
// THE NEGATIVE CONTROL IS THE POINT. --action-file defaults to this worktree's
// action.yml, and the baseline records the PRE-FIX action from tag v1.7.0
// alongside it, read out of git at run time rather than committed as a second
// copy. A harness that reports the current action clean proves nothing on its
// own: it has to be shown catching the attack on the action that had it. If the
// v1.7.0 cases ever stop showing the attack, this harness has stopped being able
// to see the thing it exists to watch for, and --compare fails on that just as
// loudly as on a regression.
