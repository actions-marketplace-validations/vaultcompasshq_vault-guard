// WHY A SERVER RATHER THAN A STUB. The two routes the action's install boundary
// closes are both decisions REAL npm makes -- which registry it reads its
// configuration from, and whether an already-installed copy satisfies a spec.
// The jest suites stub npm, so they can prove the action no longer ASKS npm to
// run from the checkout and cannot prove what npm does when it is. That needs
// the real client, and the real client needs something answering HTTP. It must
// not be npmjs.org: the harness has to run offline, and pointing a proven
// attack at a public registry is not a thing to do on purpose.
//
// EVERY REQUEST IS LOGGED, which is the point of the evil instance. "The scanner
// did not come from the attacker's registry" is proven by that server's request
// log being empty, not by reasoning about npm's config precedence. A log entry
// there is the attack connecting.
